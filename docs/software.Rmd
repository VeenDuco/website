##### Kullback-Leibler divergence
This application shows a visual representation of Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence. It was created to support the explanation of KL divergence in the manuscript "Using the Data Agreement Criterion to Rank Experts' Beliefs"

##### Sampling Correlations
This application was developed for educational purposes. It shows sampling from a bivariate distribution under different sample sizes and true correlations. The application also shows the history or sampling distribution for both the correlation statistic and its p-value if multiple samples from the same population are drawn.

##### GLMMRR 

This package can be used to analyse Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) for Binary Randomized Response (RR) Data. Link functions that can be used are Cauchit, Compl. Log-Log, Logistic, and Probit link functions for Bernoulli Distributed RR data. RR designs that are included are: Warner, Forced Response, Unrelated Question, Kuk, Crosswise, and Triangular.
