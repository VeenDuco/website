However, generalization of such an algorithm and thus achieving a similar classification performance is only possible when the training data used to build the algorithm is similar to new unseen data one wishes to apply it to. It is often unknown in advance how an algorithm will perform on new unseen data, being a crucial reason for not deploying an algorithm at all. Therefore, tools are needed to measure the similarity of data sets. In this paper, we propose the Data Representativeness Criterion (DRC) to determine how representative a training data set is of a new unseen data set. We present a proof of principle, to see whether the DRC can quantify the similarity of data sets and whether the DRC relates to the performance of a supervised classification algorithm. We compared a number of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets, ranging from subtle to severe difference is acquisition parameters. Results indicate that, based on the similarity of data sets, the DRC is able to give an indication as to when the performance of a supervised classifier decreases. The strictness of the DRC can be set by the user, depending on what one considers to be an acceptable underperformance.","tags":["MRI","Machine learning","Data acquisition","Algorithms","Computer Vision"],"title":"The Data Representativeness Criterion.

The present study explored the applicability of the hybrid visual fixation paradigm (Houston et al., 2007) and the associated statistical analysis approach to assess individual discrimination of a native vowel contrast, /a:/ - /e:/, in Dutch 6 to 10-month-old infants. Houston et al. found that 80% (8/10) of the 9-month-old infants successfully discriminated the contrast between pseudowords boodup-seepug. Using the same approach, we found that 12% (14/117) of the infants in our sample discriminated the highly salient /a:/ -/e:/ contrast. This percentage was reduced to 3% (3/117) when we corrected for multiple testing. Bayesian hierarchical modeling indicated that 50% of the infants showed evidence of discrimination. Advantages of Bayesian hierarchical modeling are that 1) there is no need for a correction for multiple testing and 2) better estimates at the individual level are obtained. Thus, individual speech discrimination can be more accurately assessed using state of the art statistical approaches.","tags":["Speech sound discrimination","Hybrid visual fixation","Individual analysis","Autoregressive error structure","Bayesian hierarchical modeling"],"title":"A step forward.

Guidelines recommend treating patients with an internal carotid artery near occlusion (ICANO) with best medical therapy (BMT) based on weak evidence. Consequently, patients with ICANO were excluded from randomized trials. The aim of this individual-patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was to determine the optimal treatment approach. Methods. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases in January 2018. The primary outcome was the occurrence of any stroke or death within the first 30 days of treatment, analysed by multivariable mixed-effect logistic regression. The secondary outcome was the occurrence of any stroke or death beyond 30 days up to 1 year after treatment, evaluated by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. Results. The search yielded 1526 articles, of which 61 were retrieved for full-text review. Some 32 studies met the inclusion criteria and pooled IPD were available from 11 studies, including some 703 patients with ICANO. Within 30days, any stroke or death was reported in six patients (1.8 per cent) in the carotid endarterectomy (CEA) group, five (2.2 per cent) in the carotid artery stenting (CAS) group and seven (4.9 per cent) in the BMT group. This resulted in a higher 30-day stroke or death rate after BMT than after CEA (odds ratio 5.63, 95 per cent c.i. 1.30 to 24.45; P = 0.021). No differences were found between CEA and CAS. The 1-year any stroke- or death-free survival rate was 96.1 per cent for CEA, 94.4 per cent for CAS and 81.2 per cent for BMT. Conclusion. These data suggest that BMT alone is not superior to CEA or CAS with respect to 30-day or 1-year stroke or death prevention in patients with ICANO. These patients do not appear to constitute a high-risk group for surgery, and consideration should made to including them in future RCTs of internal carotid artery interventions.","tags":null,"title":"Meta analysis of the outcomes of treatment of internal carotid artery near occlusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"8dfb707e918160a0554aa9945c4af2f3","permalink":"https://www.ducoveen.com/project/package-shinystan3/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/package-shinystan3/","section":"project","summary":"ShinyStan provides immediate, informative, customizable visual and numerical summaries of model parameters and convergence diagnostics for MCMC simulations.","tags":["R-Package"],"title":"shinystan 3.0","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jean-Paul Fox","Duco Veen","Konrad Klotzke"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544572800,"objectID":"f0a4c61398ddbc3aed0bc1593c9f150f","permalink":"https://www.ducoveen.com/publication/glmmrr/","publishdate":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/glmmrr/","section":"publication","summary":"Response bias (nonresponse and social desirability bias) is one of the main concerns when asking sensitive questions about behavior and attitudes. Self-reports on sensitive issues as in health research (e.g., drug and alcohol abuse), and social and behavioral sciences (e.g., attitudes against refugees, academic cheating) can be expected to be subject to considerable misreporting. To diminish misreporting on self-reports, indirect questioning techniques have been proposed such as the randomized response techniques. The randomized response techniques avoid a direct link between individual’s response and the sensitive question, thereby protecting the individual’s privacy. Next to the development of the innovative data collection methods, methodological advances have been made to enable a multivariate analysis to relate responses to sensitive questions to other variables. It is shown that the developments can be represented by a general response probability model (including all common designs) by extending it to a generalized linear model (GLM) or a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). The general methodology is based on modifying common link functions to relate a linear predictor to the randomized response. This approach makes it possible to use existing software for GLMs and GLMMs to model randomized response data. The R-package GLMMRR makes the advanced methodology available to applied researchers. The extended models and software will seriously improve the application of the randomized response methodology. Three empirical examples are given to illustrate the methods.","tags":["generalized linear model","mixed effect model","randomized response","social desirability","survey designs"],"title":"Generalized Linear Mixed Models for Randomized Responses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Duco Veen","Diederick Stoel","Naomi Schalken","Kees Mulder","Rens van de Schoot"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533772800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533772800,"objectID":"c19698081a6d9b8c5e18e110db63f6f9","permalink":"https://www.ducoveen.com/publication/dac/","publishdate":"2018-08-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dac/","section":"publication","summary":"Experts' beliefs embody a present state of knowledge. It is desirable to take this knowledge into account when making decisions. However, ranking experts based on the merit of their beliefs is a difficult task. In this paper, we show how experts can be ranked based on their knowledge and their level of (un)certainty. By letting experts specify their knowledge in the form of a probability distribution, we can assess how accurately they can predict new data, and how appropriate their level of (un)certainty is. The expert's specified probability distribution can be seen as a prior in a Bayesian statistical setting. We evaluate these priors by extending an existing prior-data (dis)agreement measure, the Data Agreement Criterion, and compare this approach to using Bayes factors to assess prior specification. We compare experts with each other and the data to evaluate their appropriateness. Using this method, new research questions can be asked and answered, for instance, Which expert predicts the new data best? Is there agreement between my experts and the data? Which experts' representation is more valid or useful? Can we reach convergence between expert judgement and data? We provided an empirical example ranking (regional) directors of a large financial institution based on their predictions of turnover.","tags":["Bayes","Bayes factor","decision making","expert judgement","Kullback-Leibler divergence","prior-data (dis)agreement","ranking"],"title":"Using the Data Agreement Criterion to Rank Experts' Beliefs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Duco Veen","Diederick Stoel","Mariëlle Zondervan-Zwijnenburg","Rens van de Schoot"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512432000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512432000,"objectID":"821b39330b10614cfd60364f3572576e","permalink":"https://www.ducoveen.com/publication/five-step-method/","publishdate":"2017-12-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/five-step-method/","section":"publication","summary":"Elicitation is a commonly used tool to extract viable information from experts. The information that is held by the expert is extracted and a probabilistic representation of this knowledge is constructed. A promising avenue in psychological research is to incorporated experts’ prior knowledge in the statistical analysis. Systematic reviews on elicitation literature however suggest that it might be inappropriate to directly obtain distributional representations from experts. The literature qualifies experts’ performance on estimating elements of a distribution as unsatisfactory, thus reliably specifying the essential elements of the parameters of interest in one elicitation step seems implausible. Providing feedback within the elicitation process can enhance the quality of the elicitation and interactive software can be used to facilitate the feedback. Therefore, we propose to decompose the elicitation procedure into smaller steps with adjustable outcomes.We represent the tacit knowledge of experts as a location parameter and their uncertainty concerning this knowledge by a scale and shape parameter. Using a feedback procedure, experts can accept the representation of their beliefs or adjust their input. We propose a Five-Step Method which consists of (1) Eliciting the location parameter using the trial roulette method. (2) Provide feedback on the location parameter and ask for confirmation or adjustment. (3) Elicit the scale and shape parameter. (4) Provide feedback on the scale and shape parameter and ask for confirmation or adjustment. (5) Use the elicited and calibrated probability distribution in a statistical analysis and update it with data or to compute a prior-data conflict within a Bayesian framework. User feasibility and internal validity for the Five-Step Method are investigated using three elicitation studies.","tags":["Bayesian statistics","elicitation","expert judgment","expert knowledge","Five-Step Method","prior"],"title":"Proposal for a Five-Step Method to Elicit Expert Judgment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"876326c5241bed627257e444804c6aa6","permalink":"https://www.ducoveen.com/project/shiny-correlation/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/shiny-correlation/","section":"project","summary":"Draw your own bivariate distribution and see what correlations and regression models you would find.
