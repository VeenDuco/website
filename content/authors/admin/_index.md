bio: I currently hold a post-doctoral position at the department of Methodology & Statistics of Utrecht University in the Netherlands. From December until April I'm consulting as a scientific project manager for [Rick Grobbee](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/Research/Strategic-themes/Circulatory-Health/Prof-dr-Rick-Grobbee) at the University Medical Center Utrecht. My research interests lie primarily in the area of Bayesian statistics. My docteral thesis, under the supervision of [Rens van de Schoot](https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/), concerned the use of Bayesian statistics, expert elicitation and information theory in the social sciences. I defended my thesis on March 13 at the acadamy building in Utrecht.
